# Change Log

All notable changes to the "flutter-stylizer" extension will be documented in

Please make sure you have a backup (preferably in git) of your code before running
"Flutter Stylizer" in case it doesn't handle your code properly.

## [0.0.16] - 2020-04-05

- Add `flutterStylizer.memberOrdering` configuration property to allow
  customization of member ordering, requested in #11.

## [0.0.13] - 2019-07-09
- Adds a statusbar button (on the lower left) to run the stylizer command on the current file.
  The button appears whenever an editor with the language type `dart` is the active editor.
  This is accomplished with a language-based "activation event" for "flutter-stylizer".

- This feature was generously added by @sketchbuch in #7.
