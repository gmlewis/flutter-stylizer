# flutter-stylizer README

Flutter Stylizer is a VSCode extension that organizes your Flutter classes
in an opinionated and consistent manner.

## Features

Flutter Stylizer organizes the class(es) within a `*.dart` file
in the following manner (with a blank line separating these parts):

* The main (possibly factory) constructor is listed first, if it exists.
  - (`public-constructor` in configuration)
* Any named constructors are listed next, in sorted order.
  - (`named-constructors` in configuration)
* Any static (class) variables are listed next, in sorted order.
  - (`public-static-variables` in configuration)
* Any instance variables are listed next, in sorted order.
  - (`public-instance-variables` in configuration)
* Any private static (class) variables are listed next, in sorted order.
  - (`private-static-variables` in configuration)
* Any private instance variables are listed next, in sorted order.
  - (`private-instance-variables` in configuration)
* Any `@override` methods are listed next, in sorted order.
  - (`public-override-methods` in configuration)
* Any other methods are listed next in their original (unchanged) order.
  - (`public-other-methods` in configuration)
* The `build` method is listed last.
  - (`build-method` in configuration)

I have found that developer productivity increases when all code in
large projects follows a consistent and opinionated style.

Additionally, bringing new developers into a team with a large code base
is easier when the code is consistently written and therefore easier
to navigate and understand.

Without tooling to enforce a consistent style, developing code is less fun.
Having an automated tool to do this ugly work for you, however, makes
coding a lot more enjoyable, as you don't have to worry about the rules,
but can just run the plugin on file save, and the rules are automatically
enforced.

## Configuration

To override the default order of the stylizer, add a section to your
VSCode User Preferences (`Control/Cmd-,`) like this:

```
  "flutterStylizer.memberOrdering": [
      "public-constructor",
      "named-constructors",
      "public-static-variables",
      "public-instance-variables",
      "private-static-variables",
      "private-instance-variables",
      "public-override-methods",
      "public-other-methods",
      "build-method",
  ],
```

And then rearrange as member names desired.

## Limitations

This plugin does not have a full-featured Dart syntax tree parser.
As a result, it may come across Dart code that it doesn't handle properly.
See the [Known Issues](#known-issues) section below for more details.

## Reporting Problems

It is my goal to be able to use this plugin on large group projects, so
every attempt has been made to make this robust. If, however, problems
are found, please raise issues on the [GitHub issue tracker] for this repo
along with a (short) example demonstrating the "before" and "after" results
of running this plugin on the example code.

Even better, please submit a PR with your new "before"/"after" example coded-up
as a unit test along with the code to fix the problem, and I'll try to
incorporate the fix into the plugin.

***Please remember to state which version of the plugin you are using!***

## Known Issues

* Flutter Stylizer is line-oriented. It is meant to be run on code that
  is nicely separated by lines.  The `dartfmt` tool typically makes
  sane-looking code, and this is the type of code that is being targeted
  by this extension.
* Code that follows the end of a multiline comment on the same
  line is not supported. Unusual code like this will most likely not ever be
  supported even though the Dart compiler can handle it.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.16

- Add `flutterStylizer.memberOrdering` configuration property to allow
  customization of member ordering, requested in #11.

### 0.0.15

- Fix incorrectly-identified named constructor reported in #9.

### 0.0.14

- Upgrade lodash to fix security vulnerability in #8.

### 0.0.13

- Adds a statusbar button (on the lower left) to run the stylizer command on the current file.
  The button appears whenever an editor with the language type `dart` is the active editor.
  This is accomplished with a language-based "activation event" for "flutter-stylizer".
- Adds an extension dependency to the Dart extension (this adds `dart` as an editor language).
- This feature was generously added by @sketchbuch in #7.

### 0.0.12

- Incorporate vulnerability fixes from #3, #4, and #5.

### 0.0.11

- Fix bugs running on flutter package.

### 0.0.10

- Fix await bug.

### 0.0.9

- npm update vscode.

### 0.0.8

- Improve spacing for single-line variables.

### 0.0.7

- Fix instance variable bug.

### 0.0.6

- Keep groups of comments associated with following entity.

### 0.0.5

- Fix bugs found with abstract classes, getters, and @overrides.

### 0.0.4

- Add support for missing getters.

### 0.0.3

- Fix placement of getters with other methods.

### 0.0.2

- Preserve solitary single- and multi-line comments.

### 0.0.1

- Initial release, "Flutter Stylizer" is the provided command.
